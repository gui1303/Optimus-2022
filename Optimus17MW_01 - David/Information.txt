-getOPs: read steady states generated with OpenFAST to obtain 
pitch angle at each one of the selected operational points and
interpolate the kp. The maximum and minimum values for kp were 
fixed based on two extrems: the minimum is the value where the stability
between 13 and 16m/s was achieved, and the maximum where tower strike 
above 28m/s was avoided. 

-RunExample: run simulations with constant wind.
